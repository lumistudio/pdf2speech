    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> September 26, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Social Swap AI Video Generator</strong> (the "App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our Android application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. What the App Does</h2>
    <p>The App lets users create images using artificial intelligence from text prompts, transform or stylize uploaded photos, and save/share the generated images. Core features include text-to-image generation, image-to-image transformation (e.g., style transfer, avatar creation), filters and presets, and the ability to save or export your creations.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following categories of information to operate and improve the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User-provided content:</strong> Text prompts, uploaded photos/images, and any text or media you submit while using the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> If you create an account, we may collect your email address, display name, and other profile information you provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, device identifiers (where permitted), language, and app version.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage analytics:</strong> Anonymous or pseudonymized data about how you use the App (features used, session length, crashes, performance data) to improve our service.</li>
      <li><strong>Log data:</strong> Server logs such as IP address, timestamps, and actions performed in the App for troubleshooting and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for purposes that include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining the App and its features.</li>
      <li>Generating images or transformations based on prompts and uploaded images.</li>
      <li>Improving and personalizing the App experience (e.g., recommending styles or presets).</li>
      <li>Detecting and preventing abuse, fraud, or other harmful activity.</li>
      <li>Diagnosing technical issues and monitoring performance.</li>
      <li>Communicating with you about updates, features, or support requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. AI Training & Use of User Content</h2>
    <p><strong>Model training:</strong> We will not use your uploaded photos or prompts to train or improve our core AI models unless you explicitly opt in. If we ever plan to use user content for research or training, we will notify you and request consent.</p>
    <p><strong>Service operations:</strong> To provide the image-generation service we may temporarily store prompts and uploaded images on our servers and process them using third-party or in-house AI models. This processing is necessary to deliver the functionality you request.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights Over Generated Content</h2>
    <p><strong>Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of the photos and prompts you upload. For images generated by the App, you retain ownership or broad usage rights as described in the App's Terms of Service (check the Terms for specific license details).</p>
    <p><strong>License to operate the service:</strong> By uploading content or generating images, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to store, display, and transmit that content as needed to operate, improve, and display the App and to provide customer support. This license does not transfer ownership.</p>

    <h2>6. Moderation, Prohibited Content, and Automated Decisions</h2>
    <p>We may apply automated filtering to prompts and uploaded images to detect and block prohibited or disallowed content (e.g., nudity, hate speech, illegal activities). Content that violates our policies may be removed and accounts may be suspended. Automated decisions may be used for moderation; if you believe a moderation action was in error, contact us to request review.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services to operate the App. These may include cloud hosting, analytics, crash reporting, payment processors, and advertising networks. Examples include (but are not limited to):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud hosting providers (for storing and processing images)</li>
      <li>Analytics and crash reporting (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase)</li>
      <li>Ad networks (e.g., Google AdMob) if ads are shown</li>
      <li>Payment processors for in-app purchases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties collect and process data according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their policies for more information.</p>

    <h2>8. Ads and Personalized Advertising</h2>
    <p>If the App displays ads, ad networks may collect device and usage information to deliver and personalize advertising. You can limit personalized ads via your device settings or the opt-out mechanisms provided by the ad networks.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain the data necessary to operate the App and to comply with legal obligations. Uploaded images, prompts, and generated images are retained according to the App's storage policy — typically as long as your account exists or for a limited time if you use the service without an account. We remove or anonymize data that is no longer necessary.</p>

    <h2>10. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect data against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. Please take care not to share highly sensitive personal information in prompts or uploads.</p>

    <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us data, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>12. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We may transfer and store information on servers located outside your country. When we transfer personal information internationally, we will take steps to ensure it is protected in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

    <h2>13. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Update or delete content:</strong> You may delete your account or request removal of uploaded images and generated content by contacting us (see Contact section).</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-out of analytics:</strong> Where possible, you can disable analytics collection in the App or via device-level privacy settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Ads:</strong> Opt out of personalized ads using your device advertising settings or the ad network opt-out tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make material changes we will provide notice within the App or by updating the effective date above. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
